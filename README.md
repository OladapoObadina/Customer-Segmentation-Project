### Background
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in our consulting company's Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about the company's expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.

Smith discusses our expertise in this space. In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

### Task
Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of Sprockets new customers in the 'new customer list' dataset should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

### Plan
- Split Sprockets existing customer base into various segments that can be individually targeted using techniques such as K-Means Clustering and Recency, Frequency and Monetary segmentation.
- Develop a supervised learning model to predict which segments Sprockets new customers would fall under.
